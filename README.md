# To Do List

The project presents a simple responsive To Do application.  
The application has two lists.  
The main one, which displays the current day, and work list.  
In each of them it is possible to add tasks to perform, which they do not integrate into another list.  
When the task is completed and the checkbox is selected, the text is crossed out.
